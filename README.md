The dynamic and ever-changing character of the fashion industry is well-known. Social media, cultural shifts, and celebrity endorsements are just a few of the variables that can cause trends to form quickly. The objective of this project is to discover fashion product trends by assigning a trend score to each product, which will assist consumers and industry stakeholders in classifying the products as trending or lagging. Utilising product demand in the market and headlines from fashion websites is the proposed methodology. A weighted vote ensemble of Random Forest, Decision Tree and Linear Regression optimised via the Nelder-Mead optimisation technique is the algorithm utilised for demand forecasting. The results indicate that the ensemble of Linear Regression and Random Forest outperformed other models with an R2 score of 92.84%. Businesses may quickly and intelligently classify products by using the identified trend score, which helps them to match their strategy to the most recent market trends.

The project's strength is its comprehensive approach, which takes into account the ever-changing effects of social media, celebrity endorsements, and cultural shifts on fashion trends. The methodology's flexibility in response to the fashion industry's fast changes makes it a useful resource for companies looking for data-driven insights to inform their decisions.
